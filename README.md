# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### PyBer Dataset
PyBer is a python based ride share app company. Two datasets were used: *city_data.csv* and *ride_data.csv.* *city_data.csv* contains data the number of drivers per city and the city type for each city. *ride_data.csv* contains data on ride date, ride fare, and ride ID for each city. These datasets were cleaned, merged, analysed and visualised using Python version 3.7 in Jupyter Notebook. 

### Analysis Goals
The overall goal of this analysis is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neightborhoods. This analysis provides a summary of ride share data by city type: urban, suburban and rural. The first deliverable is a summary data frame and the second is plot of ride fare over time.
